# Feature List

> **Status:** 0 of N features complete
> **Last Updated:** [DATE]

## How to Use This File

- Features are listed in suggested implementation order (dependencies first)
- Each feature has binary tests — checkbox items that pass or fail
- A feature is **complete** when ALL its tests pass
- Only mark tests as passing after actually verifying them
- Don't modify test definitions — only check/uncheck boxes

## CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Project: [PROJECT_NAME]

## Overview

[2-3 sentences describing what this project is and its primary purpose]

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [e.g., Next.js, React, Vue]
- **Language:** [e.g., TypeScript, JavaScript, Python]
- **Styling:** [e.g., Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules]
- **Key Libraries:** [List important dependencies]

## Project Structure

```
[Will be filled in after initial scaffolding]
```

## Workflow

This project follows a structured feature-by-feature development workflow. Before starting any work:

1. Read `docs/features.md` to understand the full feature scope and current status
2. Read `docs/progress.md` to understand recent work and context
3. Check `git log --oneline -10` for recent changes
4. Run the dev server and verify existing features still work
5. Work on ONE feature at a time until all its tests pass
6. Update progress.md, commit, then end the session

## Key Files

- `docs/features.md` — Full feature list with binary tests (the source of truth)
- `docs/progress.md` — Session-by-session narrative log
- `CLAUDE.md` — This file (project context and workflow)

## Architecture Decisions

## Usage Notes

### Status Indicators

Use these consistently across features:
- 🔴 **Not Started** - No work begun
- 🟡 **In Progress** - Currently being implemented
- 🟢 **Complete** - All tests passing

### Feature Ordering

Order features by dependency:
1. Foundation features (no dependencies) first
2. Features that depend on #1 next
3. Continue building up the dependency tree
4. Nice-to-have features at the end

### Test Writing Guidelines

Each feature should have 8-15 tests covering:
- Basic visibility and presence
- Core functionality (happy path)
- User interactions
- State changes
- Edge cases
- Error handling

### Dependency Notation

- `None` - No dependencies, can be built first
- `Feature 1` - Depends on a single feature
- `Features 1, 3` - Depends on multiple features
