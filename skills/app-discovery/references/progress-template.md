# progress.md Template

Template for the progress log generated by app-creator. This file is a **session log**, not a reference document.

---

## What progress.md IS

- Chronological record of sessions
- Narrative of what happened and why
- Decisions made (briefly, not duplicating CLAUDE.md)
- Gotchas discovered
- Next steps after each session

## What progress.md IS NOT

- ❌ Duplicate of CLAUDE.md (tech stack, architecture)
- ❌ Feature specifications (that's features.md)
- ❌ Project overview (that's CLAUDE.md)
- ❌ Source of truth for anything except session history

## Discovery Session — 2024-12-28

Completed app discovery for the Elyse Speech Visualizer.

### What Was Decided

- **Rendering**: Canvas 2D — Easier lo-fi aesthetic than WebGL
- **Integration**: Parallel mode — Visualizer accompanies chat, doesn't replace
- **Semantic**: Keyword dictionary — Start simple, modular for future LLM
- **Controls**: Macro only — 3 sliders + 1 toggle, not a full mixer

### Scope

- 11 features identified
- 110 binary tests defined
- Deferred to v2: Sketchy Lines, Blobs, Presets

### Ready For

- Project scaffolding
- Feature 1: Audio Adapter

### Next Steps

- [ ] Run `/dev-protocol:init` to scaffold and initialize
- [ ] Begin Feature 1: Audio Adapter

---

## Dev Protocol Initialized — 2024-12-29

### Scaffolding

- [x] React/TypeScript project created (Vite)
- [x] Folder structure per CLAUDE.md
- [x] Dependencies installed
- [ ] .env.local configured (Eleven Labs API key needed)

### Sprint Infrastructure

- [x] Created .sprint/ directory
- [x] Generated init.sh

### Ready For

- Feature 1: Audio Adapter (11 tests)

---

## Sprint 1: Audio Adapter — 2024-12-29

### Completed

## Usage Notes

1. **Keep entries brief** — Details belong in CLAUDE.md or features.md
2. **Be consistent** — Use the same format for every session
3. **Update immediately** — Log while context is fresh
4. **Link to commits** — Include hash for traceability
5. **Note blockers** — Future sessions need to know what stopped you
